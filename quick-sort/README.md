Quicksort is an in-place sorting algorithm. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be somewhat faster than merge sort and about two or three times faster than heapsort.

| Info       | Worst complexity | Average complexity | Best complexity |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Quick Sort | `n*2`            | `n*log(n)`         | `n*log(n)`      |
