 radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix.

 | Info       | Worst complexity | Average complexity | Best complexity |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Radix Sort | `n*k/d`            | `n*k/d`         | `n+2^d`      |
