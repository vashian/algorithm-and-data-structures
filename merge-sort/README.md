merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output

| Info       | Worst complexity | Average complexity | Best complexity | Space complexity |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Merge Sort | `n*log(n)`       | `n*log(n)`         | `n*log(n)`      | `n`              |
